Create a comprehensive learning roadmap tailored to this learner:

LEARNER PROFILE:
- Experience Level: ${userContext.experienceLevel}
- Current Skills: ${userContext.skillsText}
- Learning Goals: ${userContext.goalsText}
- Available Time: ${userContext.timeAvailable} hours per week
- Preferred Learning Time: ${userContext.profile?.preferred_learning_time || 'Not specified'}

ROADMAP REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create 4-6 modules that build logically toward their goals
2. Each module MUST include exactly 4-5 diverse learning resources
3. Each module MUST include exactly 3 hands-on tasks/projects
4. Tailor difficulty to match their experience level
5. Ensure progression leads directly toward their stated goals
6. Skip topics they already know well - focus on growth areas

RESOURCE GUIDELINES:
- Mix resource types: videos, documentation, tutorials, articles, interactive content
- Use real platforms: MDN, YouTube, FreeCodeCamp, official docs, Coursera, etc.
- Provide realistic time estimates (15-120 minutes per resource)
- Title resources specifically (e.g., "MDN: JavaScript Arrays Documentation", "YouTube: React Hooks Tutorial")

TASK GUIDELINES:
- Include practice exercises, projects, and quizzes
- Make tasks progressively challenging within each module
- Ensure tasks apply concepts from the resources
- Provide clear, actionable descriptions
- Range from 30-180 minutes per task

Focus on practical, industry-relevant skills that directly support their career goals. Consider their time constraints and create a realistic timeline.`;

- For content changes: Add/remove modules, adjust focus areas, include/exclude technologies
- For pace changes: Modify time estimates, combine/split modules, adjust weekly workload
- Always explain what changes were made and why
