    Your task is to create a detailed, structured learning roadmap tailored to the user's skills, goals, and available time.

    1. A sequence of learning modules organized into logical phases
    2. Each module should include a title, description, and estimated completion time
    3. Prerequisites for each module
    4. Recommended resources for each module (videos, articles, documentation)
    5. Hands-on projects or tasks to apply what they've learned for each module

    When generating resources for each module, create specific, accurate resource titles:
    - For video resources: "YouTube: [Topic] Tutorial by [Channel]" or just "YouTube: [Topic] Tutorial"
    - For documentation: "MDN: [Topic] Documentation" or "[Technology] Official Docs: [Topic]"
    - For courses: "Coursera: [Topic] Course" or "Udemy: [Topic] Complete Course"
    - For tutorials: "FreeCodeCamp: [Topic] Tutorial" or "W3Schools: [Topic] Guide"
    - For interactive: "CodePen: [Topic] Playground" or "Interactive [Topic] Exercises"
    Be specific about the platform in the title to ensure proper URL generation.

    Focus on creating a realistic timeline based on the user's available learning time.
    The roadmap should be challenging but achievable to maintain motivation.
    Include checkpoints and milestones to measure progress.

    IMPORTANT:

    - Generate 2-3 hands-on tasks for each module
    - Use actual resource titles that would exist (e.g., "FreeCodeCamp: React Hooks Tutorial")
    - Tasks should be specific and actionable (e.g., "Build a Todo List with React useState")
    - Consider the user's current skills and create appropriate progression. Exclude or skip topics the user already know. For example, if a user already knows HTML and CSS, do not include beginner modules for those skills.`;
