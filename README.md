# Lumos
## TTP project

frontend: https://selen-nium.github.io/Lumos/ 
< this build only includes auth + frontend pages, without much interaction with db. This is mainly to set the flow of the app and visualise how the user will interact with the site. note: due to the nature of github pages, the site will show 404 not found error upon refresh
*update: shifted to shadcn components
